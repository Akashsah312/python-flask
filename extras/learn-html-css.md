title: Learning HTML and CSS

Let's face it: our homepage is not _that_ spectacular. A picture of a cat, some text shadow and a custom font isn't exactly ground-breaking. If you are looking to develop your web skills and have a bit of an eye for design, here is a guide for getting you started.

The first thing to know is that web design is all about experimentation. It's a _do stuff_ sort of place. It might be tempting to pull out a pen and paper every time you want to design a new page, and many people start out that way. But it can be a very frustrating experience. HTML and CSS can be incredibly inflexible one way, and also completely open in another. For example, you can do anything you like with squares, any `<div>` tag is basically a rectangle, but how do you make triangles? If you doodled a nice pretty triangular design you might be in for a bit of a shock when it came time to create the HTML.

So it's time to play around, and you know what? It's a _great_ time to play around. There are more web gurus than ever and a ton of good resources available for free online.

## Online Playgrounds

Messing around with HTML/CSS and Javascript can be annoying on your local computer. You need at least an editor and a web server, then you are constantly going through the edit-save-reload cycle. After a while you can get used to it, but there are some good online services that let you hack away for free.

* [CSSDeck](http://cssdeck.com/) is simple and effective and includes lots of more complicated examples. Check out the  _Cats Everywhere_ home page [here](http://cssdeck.com/labs/aqzfyeyn).
* [Codepen](http://codepen.io/) is a bit fancier, with paid-for plans for people wanting some extra features. ([cats Everywhere home page](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xcteG))
* [JsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) is one of the older sites and has more of a focus on JavaScript. Check out the [home page](http://jsfiddle.net/TcJc8/).

## References

I always find it best to have a good solid reference by my side. Sometimes I just can't remember whether it is `text-align: center;` or `text-align: middle;` and spend half an hour wondering why it doesn't work. Here are some of the more popular online references:

* HTML Dog has [HTML](http://www.htmldog.com/reference/htmltags/) and [CSS](http://www.htmldog.com/reference/cssproperties/) that are clean and straight-forward.
* Mozilla provide [HTML Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element) and [HTML Attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Attributes) references. These are much more complete than HTML Dog and include links to relevant specifications and browser compatibility.

## Tutorials

If you are looking for something a little more guided introduction to HTML/CSS and JavaScript then we have collected links to a whole pile of tutorials for you. All these can be completed online for free:

* [HTML Dog](http://www.htmldog.com/) does raw beginner HTML and CSS with a slight canine focus.
* [Mozilla Developer CSS Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/Getting_Started) is a "from scratch" CSS tutorial. It will take you all the way from basic syntax to the box model and layouts.
