title: Free hosting on Heroku

---

There are a few popular sites which let you host your Python websites for free. One of the easiest and most popular is [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

Though it was originally a hosting site for Ruby on Rails it has since expanded to cover a great number of programming languages. Now that you have done some work on Flask you can try the [Getting Started with Python on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python) article on Heroku. They specifically start with a Flask app because it is so simple and straight-forward to use.

Earlier in the workshop you saw the final working _Cats Everywhere_ website. You may have noticed that it was also running on Heroku. So if you are looking for a simple example for getting up and running take a look at the [python-flask-code](https://github.com/OpenTechSchool/python-flask-code) repository. That's the code that we send to Heroku, and you can see how we use `requirements.txt` and `Procfile` to start a Flask application.

Good luck and happy hacking!
